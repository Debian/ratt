# Description

ratt (“Rebuild All The Things!”) operates on a Debian .changes file of a just-built package, identifies all reverse-build-dependencies and rebuilds them with the .debs from the .changes file.

The intended use-case is, for example, to package a new snapshot of a Go library and verify that the new version does not break any other Go libraries/binaries.

# Installation (from git, for hacking on ratt)

Please install ratt from Debian. In case you want to hack on ratt, you can use the following commands to install Go, download ratt from git and compile/install it into your `$GOPATH`:

```bash
sudo apt-get install golang-go
export GOPATH=~/gocode
go get -u github.com/Debian/ratt
```

Start the resulting binary in `~/gocode/bin/ratt`:

```bash
~/gocode/bin/ratt -help
```

After making changes to the code, to recompile and install it again, use:

```bash
go install github.com/Debian/ratt
```

# Usage

Let’s assume you build a new version of a Go library, like so:

```bash
debcheckout golang-github-jacobsa-gcloud-dev
cd golang-github-jacobsa-gcloud-dev
dch -i -m 'dummy new version'
git commit -a -m 'dummy new version'
gbp buildpackage --git-pbuilder  
```

Now you can use ratt to identify and rebuild all reverse-build-dependencies:
```
$ ratt golang-github-jacobsa-gcloud_0.0\~git20150709-2_amd64.changes

```

ratt uses `sbuild(1)` to build packages, see https://wiki.debian.org/sbuild for instructions on how to set up sbuild. Be sure to add `--components=main,contrib,non-free` to the sbuild-createchroot line in case you want to deal with packages outside of main as well.

# Targeting a different suite

Imagine you're running Debian stable on your machine, but you're working on a package that should be built against Debian unstable (ie. sid). Here is what you're likely to get at the first try:

```
$ ratt golang-google-grpc_1.11.0-1_amd64.changes
2019/01/19 10:44:34 Loading changes file "golang-google-grpc_1.11.0-1_amd64.changes"
2019/01/19 10:44:34  - 1 binary packages: golang-google-grpc-dev
2019/01/19 10:44:34 Corresponding .debs (will be injected when building):
2019/01/19 10:44:34     golang-google-grpc-dev_1.11.0-1_all.deb
2019/01/19 10:44:34 Setting -dist=sid (from .changes file)
2019/01/19 10:44:34 Could not find InRelease file for sid . Are you missing sid in your /etc/apt/sources.list?
```

What happens here is that ratt looks into the `.changes` file, which indicates that this package belongs to sid. Ratt then tries to resolve the reverse build dependencies against sid, using `apt(1)` as configured on the system. Which means that apt must have the sid suite in its `sources.list`, and in this example it isn't. Failure ensues.

The most direct approach to solve that is to add sid to your `/etc/apt/sources.list` file, then set `Default-Release` to stable, to prevent apt from using it. It should look like this:

```
# echo 'deb http://deb.debian.org/debian sid main' >> /etc/apt/sources.list
# echo 'APT::Default-Release "stable";' >> /etc/apt/apt.conf
# apt update
$ ratt ...
```

Another approach is to use `chdist(1)`, a tool that allows to create and maintain different apt trees for different suites. Assuming that you have a sid distribution ready in your `~/.chdist`, you can then use it by setting the environment variable `APT_CONFIG`:

```
APT_CONFIG=~/.chdist/sid/etc/apt/apt.conf ratt ...
```

At last, don't forget that you can easily target any suite that you want using the `-dist` argument of ratt.
